# Wine Quality Prediction using Supervised Learning

This project was completed as part of CU Boulder's MS Data Science program. 

This project aims to compare the accuracy and precision of several machine learning models on a red wine dataset.

This dataset provides physicochemical information on red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.

Input variables (Features):
- Fixed acidity
